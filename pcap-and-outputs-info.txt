PCAP Files and Output Types Information
========================================

PCAP FILE SAVING:
-----------------

CURRENT STATUS:
- ❌ Suricata: NOT saving pcap files (only analyzing live traffic)
- ❌ Zeek: NOT saving pcap files (only analyzing live traffic)

WHY NO PCAP FILES:
- Both are configured for LIVE ANALYSIS only
- Traffic is analyzed in real-time
- Logs contain extracted data (not raw packets)

TO ENABLE PCAP SAVING:

1. Suricata - Add to suricata.yaml:
   ```yaml
   pcap:
     - interface: wlan0
       file-cnt: 1
       file-size: 100mb
       filename: /var/log/suricata/pcap.pcap
   ```

2. Zeek - Already captures but not saving pcap directly
   (Zeek analyzes and logs, not raw pcap)

SURICATA OUTPUT TYPES (All Enabled):
------------------------------------

Currently configured in suricata.yaml:
✅ alert      - Security alerts/attacks detected
✅ flow       - Network connection flows
✅ netflow    - Network flow summaries  
✅ http       - HTTP requests/responses
✅ dns        - DNS queries/responses
✅ tls        - TLS/SSL handshakes
✅ files      - File transfers
✅ ssh        - SSH connections
✅ stats      - Performance statistics

TRAFFIC MONITOR NOW SHOWS:
--------------------------
✅ All Suricata event types (with filter dropdown)
✅ Filter by: All, Alert, Flow, NetFlow, HTTP, DNS, TLS, SSH, Files
✅ Each type shows relevant details:
   - Flow: Packets/Bytes ↑↓
   - HTTP: Method, Hostname, URL
   - DNS: Query type, Domain name
   - TLS: Subject, SNI
   - Alerts: Signature name

ZEEK LOG FILES AVAILABLE:
-------------------------

Current logs being generated:
✅ conn.log       - All network connections
✅ stats.log      - Zeek statistics
✅ notice.log     - Security notices/alerts
✅ packet_filter.log - Capture filter info
✅ capture_loss.log  - Packet capture loss
✅ loaded_scripts.log - Loaded modules

Available but not yet populated (need traffic):
⏳ http.log       - HTTP requests (when web traffic occurs)
⏳ dns.log        - DNS queries (when DNS lookups occur)
⏳ ssl.log        - SSL/TLS connections (when HTTPS occurs)

TRAFFIC MONITOR SHOWS:
---------------------
✅ Zeek Connections (conn.log)
✅ Zeek HTTP Requests (http.log - when available)

TO SEE MORE ZEEK DATA:
---------------------
Generate traffic on hotspot network:
- Browse websites → Creates http.log, dns.log
- Use HTTPS → Creates ssl.log
- Any connection → Creates conn.log entries

ALL SURICATA DATA NOW VISIBLE:
------------------------------
Use the dropdown filter to see:
- All Events (combined view)
- Alerts only (security threats)
- Flow only (connection tracking)
- HTTP only (web traffic)
- DNS only (domain lookups)
- TLS only (encrypted connections)
- SSH only (SSH sessions)
- Files only (file transfers)
