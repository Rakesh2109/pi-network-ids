Severity Explanation - Suricata Alerts
=======================================

SEVERITY LEVELS:
----------------

Severity is ONLY shown for ALERT events (actual security threats detected).

For normal traffic (flow, netflow, stats), severity shows "-" (not applicable).

ALERT SEVERITY LEVELS:
---------------------

1 = LOW SEVERITY (Green badge)
   - Minor security issues
   - Informational alerts
   - Suspicious but not dangerous

2 = MEDIUM SEVERITY (Orange badge)
   - Moderate security concerns
   - Potentially malicious activity
   - Should be reviewed

3 = HIGH SEVERITY (Red badge)
   - Critical security threats
   - Active attacks detected
   - Immediate attention required

4 = CRITICAL SEVERITY (Red badge)
   - Severe security breaches
   - Active exploitation attempts
   - System compromise attempts

WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
------------------

Currently showing "3" because the code was incorrectly parsing.
NOW FIXED:
- Flow events: Show "-" (no severity, normal traffic)
- Netflow events: Show "-" (no severity, normal traffic)
- Alert events: Show actual severity (1-4) if attack detected

YOUR CURRENT DATA:
-----------------
- Flow/Netflow events: These are NORMAL traffic
  → Severity: "-" (no threat)
  → These are your ESP32 sensors connecting to MQTT
  
- If you see severity 1-4: That means Suricata detected an attack!

NO ALERTS = GOOD:
---------------
If you see "-" for severity, it means:
✅ No security threats detected
✅ Network traffic is normal
✅ Your network is SAFE

EXAMPLES:
--------

Normal Traffic (Flow):
  Severity: "-"
  Meaning: Normal connection, no threat

Security Alert:
  Severity: 3 (RED)
  Meaning: HIGH severity threat detected!
  Action: Review immediately

SUMMARY:
-------
✅ Severity "-" = Normal traffic (good!)
⚠️ Severity 1-2 = Low/Medium threat (review)
🔴 Severity 3-4 = High/Critical threat (act immediately!)

Your current traffic shows "-" because it's all normal network flow!
